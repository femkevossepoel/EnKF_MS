module m_wtime
contains
    function wtime ( )

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! WTIME returns a reading of the wall clock time.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    To get the elapsed wall clock time, call WTIME before and after a given
!    operation, and subtract the first reading from the second.
!
!    This function is meant to suggest the similar routines:
!
!      "omp_get_wtime ( )" in OpenMP,
!      "MPI_Wtime ( )" in MPI,
!      and "tic" and "toc" in MATLAB.
